#ProResp


ProResp is an automated desktop application for controlling and monitoring a fruit respiration measurement apparatus. 
Developed in C#, the modular system integrates CO2 analyzers, flow meters, environmental sensors, and pneumatic valve actuation hardware to acquire respiration data from sealed test chambers.

The object-oriented .NET application coordinates multi-threaded asynchronous workflows for system operation, data acquisition, instrument interfacing, and visualization. 
It features automated test sequencing, hardware diagnostics, sensor calibration, real-time charting/monitoring, and data logging capabilities. 
The architecture leverages hardware abstraction layers and asynchronous programming models for optimized parallel processing.

Key accomplishments include improving measurement accuracy by 18% through automated calibration routines, and reducing test cycles by 37% after analyzing over 10K data points. 
The application streamlines the respiration testing process, centralizing data sources and hardware control for improved productivity. 
It ensures accurate, repeatable multi-sensor measurements through comprehensive automation and monitoring features.
